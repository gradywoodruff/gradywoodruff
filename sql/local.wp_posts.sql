Here it is:\r\n\r\nI have traditional design stuff like my [project id=\"reel\" media=\"video\"]animation reel[/project], [project id=\"theidiot\" media=\"image\"]different[/project] album [project id=\"mercury\" media=\"image\"]art[/project] I made, the last [project id=\"americauprising\"]website[/project] I designed / developed, and my [project id=\"portfolio\"]design portfolio[/project], but my focuses have been much more experimental over the past 2 years.\r\n\r\nI created and produced a music cartoon called Dolphinhood. You can see the first [project id=\"prelude\" media=\"video\"]episode[/project] and the last [project id=\"benefits\" media=\"video\"]music video[/project]. For this project I also designed and developed a custom [project id=\"wetaf\"]tumblr[/project].\r\n\r\nI developed, designed and produced the branding for [project id=\"hllwy.co\"]Hallway[/project], a music discovery project. The most recent project I did with him is an animated interview series for Instagram Stories, if you check [a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/hllwy.co/\"]@hllwy.co[/a] on ig app an archive of these is at the top of his profile. I also wrote software that creates his instagram videos and downloads them right to his dropbox automatically every day based on what he posts on his website.\r\n\r\nThe most recent thing I\'ve been [project id=\"characteranimator\" media=\"video\"]learning[/project] is Character Animator, this is how animation projects will populate fast social media stuff like Snapchat and Stories in the near future. \r\n\r\nI would be super excited to hear about what you\'re working on next.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[signature]\r\n[links]\r\n[projects]\r\n[data]\r\n","dan design application","","publish","closed","closed","poop","20180510dan","","","2018-05-10 23:39:40","2018-05-11 03:39:40","",0,"http://gradywoodruff.dev/?post_type=letters&#038;p=721",0,"letters","",0),
